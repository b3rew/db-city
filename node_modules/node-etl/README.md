# node-etl  :

 Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) Data from between homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources.

# Install :

npm install node-etl --save;

# Extract Process :

Assume , we have **data.txt** file with the following content :

```
1 Metouia Gabes TN
2 Laban Riyadh SA
3 Annaba Annaba ALG
9 Mina Mecca SA
```
### 1. Simple Extract :

```js
   var ETL = require('node-etl');
   var extracted=ETL.extract("./data.txt",
   {delimitor:" ",headers:["id","town","city","country"]});

```
Returns an array of objects like below :
```json
 [
    {id:"1",town:"Metouia",city:"Gabes",country:"TN"},
    {id:"2",town:"Laban",city:"Riyadh",country:"SA"},
    ...
 ]
```
### 2. Custom Extract :

In the previous example , we have the  row like `{id:1,town:"A",city:"B",country:C}` .

What about if we want an output that:  
* joins 2nd and 3rd attributes .
* delete `id`


The solution is to use the following options :
* cols : `[[1,2],3]`
* cols_headers: `["town_city","country"]`
* cols_join `"|"`


```js
ETL.extract("./data.txt",{
                    delimitor:" ",
                    headers:["id","town","city","country"],
                    cols:[[1,2],3],
                    cols_headers:["town_city","country"],
                    cols_join:"|"

});
```

Now, output will be :

```json
 [
    {town_city:"Metouia|Gabes",country:"TN"},
    {town_city:"Laban|Riyadh",country:"SA"},
    ...
 ]
```
